As a frontend developer or software engineer, your daily workflow usually revolves around two main activities: fixing bugs and developing new features. Both require a systematic approach, a keen eye for detail, and good problem-solving skills. Here’s how I approach these tasks.

## 1. Encountering and Solving a Bug

Bugs are inevitable in software development, but a structured approach can make the process much smoother.

### Steps I Follow

1. **Understand the Bug**

   * Read the bug report carefully.
   * Reproduce the bug in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.

2. **Analyze the Code**

   * Trace the part of the codebase where the bug occurs.
   * Check recent changes that might have introduced the bug.
   * Use debugging tools like Chrome DevTools or VS Code debugger.

3. **Isolate the Issue**

   * Narrow down the problem to a specific component, function, or line of code.
   * Write temporary logs or use breakpoints to understand the flow.

4. **Propose a Fix**

   * Consider multiple solutions and evaluate their impact.
   * Ensure the fix doesn’t introduce new bugs (side effects).

5. **Test the Solution**

   * Write unit tests if possible.
   * Test across different browsers and devices.
   * Validate that the bug is resolved without affecting other parts of the application. Resolve the bug at its root cause; do not use temporary patches.

6. **Document and Deploy**

   * Document the fix in the commit message and PR description.
   * Push changes and monitor after deployment.

## 2. Developing a New Feature

Building a new feature requires both creativity and structured planning. Jumping straight into coding can lead to messy, unmaintainable code.

### Steps I Follow

1. **Understand the Requirements**

   * Gather all necessary information about the feature.
   * Clarify ambiguous points with team members or product managers.

2. **Plan and Design**

   * Sketch UI/UX design if needed.
   * Define the architecture and identify reusable components.
   * Break down the feature into smaller tasks.

3. **Setup and Scaffold**

   * Create necessary components, routes, or API calls.
   * Ensure proper folder structure and naming conventions.
   * Start from main structure then details.

4. **Implement the Feature**

   * Write clean, modular code.
   * Follow best practices and coding standards.
   * Commit frequently with meaningful messages.

5. **Test Thoroughly**

   * Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
   * Verify the feature works across different browsers and devices.
   * Conduct peer code reviews.

6. **Deploy and Monitor**

   * Merge the feature branch after approval.
   * Monitor user feedback and fix any post-deployment issues.

Both debugging and feature development are integral parts of software engineering. Developing a disciplined workflow not only increases productivity but also ensures higher-quality software.

By combining methodical problem-solving with careful planning and testing, you can efficiently tackle bugs and develop new features that delight users.
